\end{question}

\subsection{2.1: Query 1}

\begin{question}
    Separately for each ticket type and for each month (of the ticket validity),
    analyze: the average daily revenue, the cumulative revenue from the beginning of
    the year, the percentage of tickets related to the considered ticket type over the
    total number of tickets of the month.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    \begin{lstlisting}[
        language=SQL,
    ]
        select s.ticketType,
            t.month,
            t.year,
            sum(s.totalAmount) / count(distinct t.validDate) as AVGDailyRevenue,
            sum(sum(s.totalAmount)) over (partition by t.year order by t.month, t.year) as ACCMonthlyRevenue,
            sum(s.numberoftickets)/sum(sum(s.numberOfTickets)) over (partition by t.month) as PercentageTicketsPerMonth
        from TicketSale s, TimeDim t
        where s.timeid = t.timeid
        group by s.ticketType, t.month, t.year
        order by s.ticketType;
    \end{lstlisting}

\end{answer}

\subsection{2.2 Query 2}

\begin{question}
    Considering the tickets of 2021. Separately for each museum and ticket type
    analyze: the average revenue for a ticket, the percentage of revenue over the total
    revenue for the corresponding museum category, assign a rank to the museum, for
    each ticket type, according to the total number of tickets in decreasing order.

\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    \begin{lstlisting}[
        language=SQL,
    ]
        select s.ticketType,
            m.museumId,
            sum(s.totalAmount)/sum(s.numberoftickets) as AVGRevenuePerTicket,
            sum(s.totalAmount)/sum(sum(s.totalAmount)) over (partition by m.category) as RevenuePercentageByCategory,
            rank() over (partition by s.ticketType order by sum(s.numberOfTickets) DESC) as MuseumRankByNumberOfTickets
        from TicketSale s, TimeDim t, Museum m
        where s.timeid = t.timeid and s.museumId = m.museumId and t.year = 2021
        group by s.ticketType, m.museumId, m.category
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}
