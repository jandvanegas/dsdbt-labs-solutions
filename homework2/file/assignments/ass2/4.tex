\section{Question 4}

\begin{question}
    Considering the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier and performing a 10-fold Stratified
    CrossValidation, what is the impact of parameter K on the average classifier accuracy? Report at
    least 5 screenshots showing the confusion matrices achieved using different K parameter values.
    Perform a 10-fold Stratified Cross-Validation with classifier Naïve Bayes. Does K-NN perform on
    average better or worse than the Naïve Bayes classifier on the analyzed data? Report a screenshot
    showing the confusion matrix achieved by Naïve Bayes on the analyzed dataset
