\section{Objective}

Exploit data mining classification algorithms to analyze a real dataset using the RapidMiner machine
learning tool.

\section{Dataset}

The Breast dataset (Breast.xls, available on the course website)collects medical data about patients who
have contracted breast cancer. Each dataset record corresponds to a different patient and consists of a set
of patient, treatment, and disease characteristics (e.g., the patient age, the tumor size). Depending upon
the tumor is a recurrent or nonrecurrent event in patient life, each record is also labeled with class label
“Recurrence events” or “No recurrence events”. Such a data attribute, which will be used as class attribute
throughout the homework, is reported as the last record attribute.

\\
The complete list of dataset attributes is reported below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Age
    \item Menopause
    \item Tumor-size
    \item Inv-nodes
    \item Node-caps
    \item Deg-malig
    \item Breast
    \item Breast-quad
    \item Irradiat
    \item class (class attribute)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Context}

Oncologists want to predict the property of recurrence or not of breast tumors according to patient, tumor,
and treatment characteristics. To this purpose, they exploit three different classification algorithms: a
decision tree (Decision Tree) and a Bayesian classifier (Naïve Bayes), and a distance-based classifier (K-NN).
The Breast dataset is used to train classifiers and to validate their performance.
